    calyx – the outer whorl of sepals that are typically green, but are petal-like in some species.

    androecium - the stamen that is made up of a filament topped by an anther where pollen containing the male gametes is produced.

A flower is the reproductive structure in flowering plants. The main function of the flower is to perpetuate the species by producing seeds for new plants to grow.

The Carnation is an example of a flower that has both male and female reproductive organs which can be seen in the following diagram of the different parts of the Carnation:

The following photograph was taken to show the male and female reproductive organs of the Carnation as they are, and intact. To achieve this image, given the petals completely conceal the male and female reproductive parts, the petals of the Carnation were folded back. This image, like the full image of the Carnation, was photographed with the Canon 20D with illumination from sun entering the window.
