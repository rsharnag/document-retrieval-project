An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. You might be thinking, “OK, but what is software?” Software is any set of instructions that performs some task on a computer. The operating system performs many essential tasks for your computer. 

It controls the memory needed for computer processes, manages disk space, controls peripheral devices, and allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing exactly how a computer works. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.
