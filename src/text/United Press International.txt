United Press International (UPI) is a news agency headquartered in the United States with roots dating back to 1907. Once a mainstay in the newswire service along with Associated Press (AP) and Reuters, it began to decline as afternoon newspapers, its chief client category, began to fail with the rising popularity of television news. This decline accelerated after the sale of UPI by the founding Scripps family culminating in two bankruptcies.
In 2000, UPI was purchased by News World Communications, an international media company founded by Sun Myung Moon the leader of the Unification Church which publishes newspapers in South America, Africa, and Asia, and formerly published The Washington Times in Washington DC. Shortly after this sale, UPI greatly downsized, eliminating many of its departments such as its Science Writing department. The news wire's daily coverage today includes domestic and international top news, business, entertainment, sports, science, health and "Quirks in the News" through its traditional NewsTrack newswire, as well as coverage and analysis of emerging threats, the security industry and energy resources through its "premium" service. UPI's content is presented in text, video and photo formats. Its news stories are filed in English, Spanish and Arabic.
