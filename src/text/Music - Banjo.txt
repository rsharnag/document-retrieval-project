he banjo is a stringed instrument with, typically, four or five strings, which vibrate a membrane of plastic material 
or animal hide stretched over a circular frame. Simpler forms of the instrument were fashioned by enslaved Africans in Colonial 
America, adapted from several African instruments of the same basic design.

The banjo is usually associated with country, folk, Irish traditional music and bluegrass music. Historically, the banjo occupied a
 central place in African American traditional music, before becoming popular in the minstrel shows of the 19th century. In fact,
 African Americans influenced early development of the music that became country and bluegrass, through the introduction of the banjo
 and through the innovation of musical techniques for both the banjo and fiddle.The banjo, with the fiddle, is a mainstay of
 American old-time music.

Recently, the banjo has enjoyed inclusion in a wide variety of musical genres, including pop crossover music, indie rock and Celtic punk.

A number of hybrid instruments exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use the body of a banjo,
 often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the banjo mandolin, the Banjolin, and the banjo 
ukulele or banjolele, most famously played by the English comedian George Formby.These were especially popular in the early decades 
of the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo
 bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric
 amplification.

Instruments using the five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, that of a bouzouki or resonator guitar) have also been made,
 such as the banjola. A 20th-Century Turkish instrument very similar to the banjo is called cümbüs.
