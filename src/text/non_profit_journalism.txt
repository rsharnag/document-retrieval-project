Non-profit journalism (abbreviated as NPJ, also known as a not-for-profit journalism or think tank jouralism) is the practice of journalism as a non-profit organization instead of a for-profit business. NPJ groups are able to operate and serve the public good without the concern of debt, dividends and the need to make a profit. Just like all non-profit organizations, NPJ outfits depend on private donations and or foundation grants to pay for operational expenses.
The recent emergence of nonprofit journalism may lead some to believe that this is a new trend in a struggling industry. However, journalism nonprofits have been operating since the beginning of the newspaper age. In 1846, five New York newspapers united[6] to share incoming reports from the Mexican-American War. That experiment in journalism became the Associated Press, which to this day is still a nonprofit cooperative.
The Center for Investigative Reporting,founded in 1977, is the nation's oldest nonprofit investigative news organization. National Public Radio was created in 1970 as a result of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. More recently, non-profit journalism organizations such as the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, ProPublica, Texas Watchdog, Stateline.org, Watchdog.org and The Huffington Post Investigative Fund, have emerged as powerful and important journalism organizations, serving the citizenry. In April 2010 a London based not-for-profit initiative was launched under the name Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
