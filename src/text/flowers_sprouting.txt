How to Learn About Flowers Sprouting
Overview

Planting flower seeds in a manner where the sprouting process is easily seen is a helpful way to learn about seed germination and growing. Choose quick germinating flower seeds, such as marigold, for the experiment so that headway on the sprouting process is quickly made and easily viewable. If teaching seed sprouting to children, allow them to do as much of the work as possible to prepare and plant the seeds so they can get a firm grasp of the process.

Step 1
Rinse out small jars, such as baby food jars, in a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water so the jars are sterile. Remove the labels and rinse with clear water. Only adults should use bleach.

Step 2
Stack two paper towels on top of each other then fold them in half lengthwise until they are as tall as the jar. Moisten them until they are damp.

Step 3
Slide the damp paper towels into the jar and press them up against the sides of the jar. Stuff crumpled up newspaper into the center of the jar to hold the paper towels in place.

Step 4
Place seeds between the jar and the paper towels using tweezers. Position the seeds so they aren't touching each other.

Step 5
Place a plastic bag over the top of the jar to keep the moisture in during sprouting. Place the jars in either a dark or light place, depending on the light requirements detailed on the seed packet for the type of flowers.

Step 6
Check on the seeds daily and look for changes in them. First the seeds will swell as they absorb the water and prepare to sprout. Then look for the first crack in the seed coat where the roots emerge from. Finally a white root will come out of the seed followed by the stem or sprout.

Step 7
Remove the sprouted seeds from the jar if desired and plant them root side down in a small pot filled with moist potting mix. Place in a well lit area and keep watered so the flower continues to grow.
