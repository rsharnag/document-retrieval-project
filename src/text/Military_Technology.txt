Military technology is the collection of equipment, vehicles, structures and communication systems that are designed for use in warfare. It comprises the kinds of technology that are distinctly military in nature and not civilian in application, usually because they are impractical in civilian application or dangerous to use without appropriate military training.
It is common for military technology to have been researched and developed by scientists and engineers specifically for use by the armed forces. Many new technologies came as a result of the military funding of science. Weapons engineering is the design, development, testing and lifecycle management of military weapons and systems. It draws on the knowledge of several traditional engineering disciplines, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mechatronics, electro-optics, aerospace engineering, materials engineering, and chemical engineering.
There is a significant number of military inventions that are technologies originally developed and designed for military purposes, and which are now used by civilians with sometimes minor or no modifications at all.
A firearm is a hand carried weapon that fires either a single or multiple projectiles using the gases produced by the rapid confined burning of a propellant.
Artillery are usually large caliber weapons firing projectiles over great distances. Artillery pieces are crew serviced weapons that provide direct or indirect trajectories for the shell.
Melee weapons include swords, clubs, spears, axes, or fists: almost any tool with which one can hit, hack or stab someone else. The term "melee" generally means man-to-man or hand-to-hand combat.
