Innovation is more than invention. An invention is something new, it can be done by a single person. Innovation is the introduction of something new, it always involves the interaction between several people. It is the process of creating and delivering new value on a market or in a community. Innovation journalism covers how innovation happens.
Traditional newsbeats - like business, technology, science and political journalism - look only at certain aspects of innovation processes and ecosystems. Innovation is treated as a topic within each beat, and the bigger picture is chopped up to fit into a specific news slot, usually technology or business journalism.
The concept of Innovation Journalism (InJo) was coined in 2003 by David Nordfors. For Innovation Journalism the process of innovation itself is the central concept, treating business, technology, politics etc. as nested components of a news story. In terms of traditional newsbeats, InJo is multidisciplinary. It is a 'horizontal' beat, spanning across the old beats, reporting on innovation processes and innovation ecosystems.
InJo identifies and reports on issues in the innovation ecosystems, such as emerging concepts, the interaction between the main actors, or what is happening in innovation value chains. It spans themes such as science and technology trends, intellectual property, finance, standardization, industrial production processes, marketing of new technologies, business models, politics, cultural trends, social impacts, and more.
InJo can be seen either as a horizontal newsbeat or as a mindset within traditional newsbeats.
One example where innovation journalism is applied is data-driven journalism, where stories are created based on analysis and visualization of data. Using data journalists can create a new viewpoint on issues that are relevant to society.
