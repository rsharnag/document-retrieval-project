1. Sepals - Although they may look like petals, they are actually the glorified remains of the flower bud. There are usually three of approximately equal size.

2. Petals - Orchids always have three petals. Two are "normal," and the third becomes a highly specialized structure called a lip.

3. Lip or Labellum - The lower petal of an orchid. Used by the flower to provide a 'landing platform' for its pollinator.

4. Column - A finger-like structure that carries the orchid's reproductive organs--the stigmatic surface (female organs) and the Pollinia (male organs) located under the Anther Cap.
