Flowers can be classified by their calyx and their corolla. The kinds of flowers by their corolla are subdivided in Cruciform, when the corolla is polypetallus and arranged in the form of a cross. Gamopetalus, when all the petals are fused together in the shape of a cylindrical tube. Papilionaceous when the corolla is partly polypetalus with five unequal petals. Infundibuliform, when the corolla is funnel shaped, and Campanulate, when the corolla is bell shaped.

Flowers by their calyx are subdivided in florets, when the calyx has a tubular shape. Bilabiate flowers, when the calyx presents two lips, one bigger than the other. Vesicular flowers, when the calyx shows as if swollen. Polysepalous flowers are presented when the calyx is clearly separated. Gamosepalus flowers have their sepals united, and Pappus flowers when the sepals are reduced to hair like structures.
