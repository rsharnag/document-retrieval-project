Political journalism is a broad branch of journalism that includes coverage of all aspects of politics and political science, although the term usually refers specifically to coverage of civil governments and political power.
Political journalism is a frequent subject of opinion journalism, as current political events are analyzed, interpreted, and discussed by news media pundits and editorialists.
The term does sometimes have negative connotations; advertising materials for the first issue of British newspaper The Daily Mail boasted that, "Four leading articles, a page of Parliament and columns of speeches will NOT be found."
