Fox News Channel (FNC), commonly referred to as Fox News or Fox, is a cable and satellite television news channel owned by the Fox Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of News Corporation. As of April 2009, it is available to 102 million households in the United States and further to viewers internationally, broadcasting primarily out of its New York City studios.
The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who hired former NBC executive Roger Ailes as the founding CEO. The channel was launched on October 7, 1996 to 17 million cable subscribers. The channel grew in the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant cable news network in the United States. Fox News finished the first quarter of 2009 as the second-most-watched cable network in primetime, behind USA Network. 
Some critics have asserted that Fox News Channel promotes conservative political positions. Fox News Channel says that its political commentary and news reporting operate independently of each other and denies any bias in its news reporting.
