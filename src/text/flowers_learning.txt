There are thousands of kinds of flowers that are either commonly grown or rare and unusual. Knowing the names of flowers can help you plan your garden and find growing and care information. The easiest names to remember are the common names which often mimic a characteristic of the plant. Scientific, or botanic, names will carry the genus and species names and are Latin in origin. These can be hard to pronounce let alone remember. Identifying flowers can be done with the help of garden books and online publications, but it is much easier to reference common flowers first so you have a good basis.

Instructions
1        Identify your flower. Ask yourself questions to narrow down the choices: annual or perennial; vine, bush or single bloom plant; growing in sun or shade. Then determine if it is common or exotic, and note its color. Use the flower book to help you reference the flower. The Internet is also an excellent way to identify flowers. Your county extension or a plant retailer should also be able to help.
2        Take a sample of the flower and a leaf to a florist shop or nursery. Put the samples in a baggie with a damp paper towel so they arrive in good condition. Or, take the samples to a Master Gardener clinic where they will be happy to help you identify what flower you have.
3        Develop a system of remembering. Using lists is a good way to commit the names to memory. The list should be organized the way you think. For instance, you might learn best with alphabetical or categorical lists. Once you have decided how to organize the list for your easiest processing, write the flower names down on a sheet of paper in that manner.
4        Memorize the flower names. Everyone has their favorite method of memorizing. The names can be written on 3- by 5-inch cards and you can include their characteristics or a picture. Use them as flash cards to test yourself. Or, write the names on Post It notes and stick them where you will see them. Repetitive viewing is a good way to commit something to memory. Sometimes it helps to say the name out loud or write it over and over. Use whatever means works best for you.
