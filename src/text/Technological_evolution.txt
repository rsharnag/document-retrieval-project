Technological evolution is the name of a science and technology studies theory describing technology development, developed by Czech philosopher Radovan Richta.
According to Richta and later Bloomfield , technology  evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends: the replacement of physical labour with more efficient mental labour, and the resulting greater degree of control over one's natural environment, including an ability to transform raw materials into ever more complex and pliable products.
The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, and must be powered by human or animal effort.
The second technological stage was the creation of the machine. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort, and requires the operator only to control its function.
The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the automation. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm.
